# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project based on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set 

Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. A Public Domain Dataset for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones. 21th European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning, ESANN 2013. Bruges, Belgium 24-26 April 2013.

In this project 

I create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The main tools that I used for this purpose were: functions rbind(), cbind(), the extensive use of regular expressions via grepl(), and functions of the library reshape2.
