The original data for this project were obtained from
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data used can be downloadeded from

The variables that were included in the final tidy data are the following:

Subject variables are ranged from 1 to 30, indicating the ID of the studied subject.
Activity variable are codified as: 1: walking, 2: walking_upstairs, 3:walking_downstairs, 4: sitting, 5: standing, 6: laying.

The rest of variables are means of the characteristics evaluated via gyroscope and detailed in the original data.
